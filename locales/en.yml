        There was an issue with the JSON response from the Digital Ocean
        API at:

        The result collection for %{collection_name}:

        %{sub_obj}

        Contained no object with the value "%{value}" for the the
        key "%{key}".

        Please ensure that the configured value exists in the collection.
      :certificate: |-
        The secure connection to the Digital Ocean API has failed. Please
        ensure that your local certificates directory is defined in the
        provider config.

            config.vm.provider :digital_ocean do |vm|
              vm.ca_path = "/path/to/ssl/ca/cert.crt"
            end

        This is generally caused by the OpenSSL configuration associated
        with the Ruby install being unaware of the system specific ca
        certs.
      :local_ip: |-
        The Digital Ocean provider was unable to determine the host's IP.
