# Vagrant Digital Ocean

`vagrant-digitalocean` is a provider plugin for Vagrant that allows the management of [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) droplets (instances).

## INSECURE

As of this writing there is no support for custom keys on the droplets created by this provider. That means anyone with the vagrant keys and the IP of your droplet has root on your machine.

*Do not use this plugin with sensitive projects*

## Status

As of this writing the provider implementation is geared entirely toward a development workflow. That is, Digital Ocean droplets are meant to be used as a replacement for VirtualBox in a server developers workflow.

## Supported Guests/Hosts

This project is primarily to support my workflow wich currently only involves Ubuntu and CentOS. It's likely that any unix host will work but I've not tested it. Guests require porting of the nfs, chef, and sudo setup scripts.

Hosts:

* Ubuntu 12.04

Guests:

* Ubuntu 12.04
* CentOS 6

## Supported Provisioners

The shell provisioner is supported by default but other provisioners require bootstrapping on the server. Chef is currently the only supported provisioner. Adding support for puppet and others requires adding the install scripts.

## Installation

Installation is performed in the prescribed manner for Vagrant 1.1 plugins.

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-digitalocean

In addition to installing the plugin the default box associated with the provider needs to be installed.

    vagrant box add digital_ocean https://raw.github.com/johnbender/vagrant-digitalocean/master/box/digital_ocean.box

## Usage

To use the Digital Ocean provider you will need to visit the [API access page](https://www.digitalocean.com/api_access) to retrieve the client identifier and API key associated with your account.

### Config

Supported provider configuration options are as follows:

```ruby
Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
  config.vm.box = "digital_ocean"

  config.vm.provider :digital_ocean do |vm|
    vm.client_id = ENV["DO_CLIENT_ID"]
    vm.api_key = ENV["DO_API_KEY"]
    vm.image = "Ubuntu 12.04 x32 Server"
    vm.region = "New York 1"
    vm.size = "512MB"
    vm.ca_path = "/usr/local/etc/openssl/ca-bundle.crt" # optional config for SSL cert on OSX and others
  end
end
```

Note that the example contains the default value. The client identifier and API key are pulled from the environment and the other values are the string representations of the droplet configuration options as provided by the [Digital Ocean API](https://www.digitalocean.com/api). The ca_path configuration option may be necessary depending on your system setup.
